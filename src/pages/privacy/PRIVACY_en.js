# Privacy policy

This privacy policy explains why Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) collects personal data when you use the Reschedule a Citizenship Test service.

This policy also explains: 

* how we store this data
* what we do with it
* how you can get a copy of the data we have about you
* how you can complain if you think we’ve done something wrong

This service is managed by IRCC. IRCC is the data controller for the personal information we hold. IRCC collects and processes personal data so that it can safely and securely provide immigration services, including those related to applications for Canadian citizenship.

Personal information is collected by IRCC under the authority of the [Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-29.4/index.html), the [Immigration and Refugee Protection Act](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html) and the [Citizenship Act](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-29/index.html).

## About personal information

Personal data is information about you as an individual. It can be your name, address or telephone number. You can find more detail on what counts as personal information in the [Privacy Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/page-1.html#h-3).

We know how important it is to protect your privacy and to comply with data protection laws. We will keep your personal data safe and will only disclose it where it is lawful to do so, or with your consent.

## Types of personal data we process

We only process personal data that is relevant for the services we are providing to you. This includes:

- your name, paper file number, and email address
- the names of any family members you wish to reschedule

We also collect site-usage information which allows us to see how the service is being used in order to allow us to improve it. This information does not contain any personal data. It includes:

- questions, queries or feedback you leave if you send a message via feedback
- your IP address, and details of which version of web browser you used

This helps us to:

- improve the site by monitoring how you use it
- respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to

We can’t personally identify you using your site usage data.

## Purpose of processing and the lawful basis for the process
